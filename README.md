# React from the Ground Up

We cover the fundementals of React including
- create a new React App starting with nothing but node.js
- review of useState() 
- how hmtl (DOM) elements can interact with State (onChange, onClick,etc)
- brief intro to useEffect()
- Creating custom Components with "props" (attributes)

There is a GIT branch for every phase of what we covered in the lecture, starting with "1-new-project" (as generated by the React cli).  You can follow along with each of the branches.  The "master" branch is the final application.
